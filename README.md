# Blossom Predictor

A machine learning project to classify **Iris flower species** based on sepal and petal dimensions. 🌸

---

## 🌟 Overview
This repository provides a complete pipeline for classifying the famous **Iris dataset** into its three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Using features like:
- Sepal length and width
- Petal length and width

---

## 💻 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalization, and data splitting.
- **Model Training**: Includes algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Data exploration and decision boundaries.
